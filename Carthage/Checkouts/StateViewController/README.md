# StateViewController


When creating rich stateful view controllers, a single view controller class is often tasked with managing the appearance of many other views, controls, and other user interface elements based on a state. That state, in turn, is often inferred from multiple properties that need to be synchronized to correctly represent a single state. Usually the end result is known as the *Massive View Controller* problem, often solved by deviating from the [MVC](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/MVC.html) pattern used and endorsed heavily by Apple. While other patterns, such as [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–viewmodel) or [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–presenter), can solve your issues, going with the grain rather than against makes interacting with UIKit a whole lot easier. *This repository houses one dependency-free class, called `StateViewController`, which is tasked with solving this issue.*


## Overview
`StateViewController` is a container view controller that presents one or more view controllers for any given state that you define, such as `loading`, `list`, or `editing`. It manages the appearance cycles of each content view controller, making sure that the view lifecycle of the content view controllers are intact and in order, notifying you about state transitions and which content view controllers are about to appear or disappear from the view hierarchy. This allos you to compose multiple view controllers and re-use them throughout the app. The state view controller also provides extensive support for animating the transition between states.

The state view controller helps you manage child view controllers representing different states. In the example application included in this project the state view controller switches between two view controllers. Firstly, it displays and animates the transition of an activity indicator view controller while a network call is being performed. Once the network call is successfully completed it transitions into a state displaying a table view with the loaded content.

## Documentation

The source code documentation can be found [here](https://formbound.github.io/StateViewController/).

## Installation
This module is available via [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). Modify your [Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#quick-start) to include `StateViewController`:

```
github "formbound/StateViewController"
```

## Usage

```swift
import StateViewController
```

To use `StateViewController` you must override it. The class is generic with a subtype of `State` which must conform to `Equatable`. The state type can be designed to house the actual model data required by your view controller, but that's an optional design decision. For instance, you can create a state that simply determines an abstract state:

```swift
enum MyState: Equatable {
    case loading
    case ready
    case error
}
```

Or, you can define a state which in itself contains model data:
```swift
enum MyState: Equatable {
    case loading
    case ready(MyModel)
    case error(Error)
}
```

Once you have a state, create a subclass of `StateViewController`.

```swift
class MyStateViewController: StateViewController<MyState>
```

Each time `StateViewController` is about to appear on screen it will call its `loadAppearanceState()` method. This method returns a state which should be ready for display as soon as the view controller is on screen. Override this method to determine what state is appropriate to display immediately, depending on cached data or the contents of your database.

```swift
override func loadAppearanceState() -> MyState {
    if let myModel = MyCache.cachedModel {
        return .ready(myModel)
    } else {
        return .loading
    }
}
```

Each state can be represented by zero or more view controllers. To provide which view controllers are visible for what state, override `contentViewControllers(for:)`.

```swift
override func contentViewControllers(for state: MyState) -> [UIViewController] {
    switch state {
        case .loading:
            return [ActivityIndicatorViewController()]
        case .ready:
            return [myTableViewController]
        case .error:
            return [ErrorViewController()]
    }
}
```

You receive callbacks for when a state transition will begin, and when it has finished.
`willTransition(to:animated:)` is a good place to prepare your content view controllers for appearance.

```swift
override func willTransition(to nextState: MyState, animated: Bool) {
    switch nextState {
        case .ready(let model):
            navigationItem.setRightBarButton(myBarButtonItem, animated: animated)
            myTableViewController.setRows(model.objects)
        default:
            navigationItem.setRightBarButton(nil, animated: animated)
    }
}
```

When `didTransition(from:animated:)` is called, a state transition has finished successfully. This is a good time to invoke other methods which in turn will trigger another state transition.

```swift
override func didTransition(from previousState: State?, animated: Bool) {
    switch currentState {
        case .loading:
            fetchData { model in
                self.setNeedsTransition(to: .ready(model), animated: true)
            }
        defualt:
            break
    }
}
```

Your `StateViewController` is now ready, and will switch between view controllers depending on state.

Multiple other callbacks are available for determining when a content view controller is appearing or disappearing. Please reference the documentation or the [Example](/Example).
