The [iPhone mockup](https://store.ramotion.com?utm_source=gthb&utm_medium=special&utm_campaign=elongation-preview) available [here](https://store.ramotion.com?utm_source=gthb&utm_medium=special&utm_campaign=elongation-preview).
<br>

## Requirements

- iOS 9.0+
- Xcode 8
- Swift 3 (<= 1.0.5)
- Swift 4 (>= 1.1)

<br>

## Installation
You can install `ElongationPreview` in several ways:

- Add source files to your project.

<br>

- Use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org):
``` ruby
pod 'ElongationPreview'
```

<br>

- Use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage):
```
github "Ramotion/elongation-preview"
```

<br>

## How to use

First of all, import module to your source file.

```swift
import ElongationPreview
```

### `ElongationViewController`

Then subclass `ElongationViewController` and configure it as you wish.

```swift
class RootViewController: ElongationViewController { }
```

Now you must register reusable cell in `tableView`. If you prefer to use Storyboards, you can drag `UITableViewCell` from bottom-right menu, *lay it out* and change it's class to `ElongationCell`. Of course, there are some specific requirements on how you can configure cell's subviews.

#### `ElongationCell`

- Easier way: copy [DemoElongationCell](/ElongationPreviewDemo/Views/DemoElongationCell/DemoElongationCell.xib) from demo project and change it as you wish. Add your own views to `top`, `bottom` and `scalable` containers.

- If you want to create cell from scratch, this is how your cell hierarchy should look like:

   ![hierarchy](/assets/elongationCellHierarchy.png)
   
  ##### Required properties:   
  `bottomView` â€” the view which comes from behind the cell when you tap on the cell.

  `scalableView` â€” the view which will be scaled when you tap on the cell.
 
  `topView` â€” static top view, add here all the views which won't be scaled and must stay on their position.

  Also you must connect this constraints: `topViewHeightConstraint`, `topViewTopConstraint`, `bottomViewHeightConstraint`, `bottomViewTopConstraint`.

<br>

>ðŸ“Œ If you need to override
>```swift
>func scrollViewDidScroll(_ scrollView: UIScrollView)
>```
>or
>```swift
>func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, willDisplay cell: UITableViewCell, forRowAt indexPath: IndexPath)
>```
>you must call `super` because some important configuration was made in these methods in superclass (`ElongationViewController`).

<br>

### `ElongationDetailViewController`

```swift
class DetailViewController: ElongationDetailViewController { }
```

If you want to display some details for objects from the `root` view, it's better to subclass `ElongationDetailViewController` and configure it for displaying your data.

This class holds `headerView` property which actually represents `ElongationCell` in expanded state and it'll be used as a header for `tableView` by default.

>ðŸ“Œ Override `openDetailView(for: IndexPath)` method, create your `ElongationDetailViewController` instance and call `expand(viewController: ElongationDetailViewController, animated: Bool)` method with this instance.
>
>This is the place where you need to configure your `ElongationDetailViewController` subclass.

<br>

## Appearance & Behaviour
You can customize both appearance & behaviour of `ElongationPreview` control by tuning some params of `ElongationConfig` and overriding `shared` instance.

```swift
// Create new config.
var config = ElongationConfig()

// Change desired properties.
config.scaleViewScaleFactor = 0.9
config.topViewHeight = 190
config.bottomViewHeight = 170
config.bottomViewOffset = 20
config.parallaxFactor = 100
config.separatorHeight = 0.5
config.separatorColor = .white

// Save created config as `shared` instance.
ElongationConfig.shared = config
```

>ðŸ—’ All parameters with their descriptions listed in [`ElongationConfig`](/ElongationPreview/Source/ElongationConfig.swift) file.
