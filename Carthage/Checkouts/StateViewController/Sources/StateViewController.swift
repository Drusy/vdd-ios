/// A container view controller that manages the appearance of one or more child view controller for any given state.
///
/// ## Overview
/// This class is designed to make stateful view controller programming easier. Typically in iOS development,
/// views representing multiple states are managed in one single view controller, leading to large view controller
/// classes that quickly become hard to work with and overlook at a glance. For instance, a view controller may
/// display an activity indicator while a network call is performed, leaving the view controller to have to directly
/// manipulate view hierarhy for each state. Furthermore, the state of a view controller tends to be represented by
/// conditions that are hard to synchronize, easily becoming a source of bugs and unexpected behavior.
/// With `StateViewController` each state can be represented by one or more view controllers.
/// This allows you to composite view controllers in self-contained classes resulting in smaller view
/// controllers and better ability modularize your view controller code, with clear separation between states.
///
/// ## Subclassing notes
///
/// You must subclass `StateViewController` and define a state for the view controller you are creating.
/// ```
/// enum MyViewControllerState: Equatable {
///     case loading
///     case ready
/// }
/// ```
/// **Note:** Your state must conform to `Equatable` in order for `StateViewController` to distinguish between states.
///
/// Override `loadAppearanceState()` to determine which state is being represented each time this view controller
/// is appearing on screen. In this method is appropriate to query your model layer to determine whether data needed
/// for a certain state is available or not.
///
/// ```
/// override func loadAppearanceState() -> MyViewControllerState {
///     if model.isDataAvailable {
///         return .ready
///     } else {
///         return .loading
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// To determine which content view controllers represent a particular state, you must override
/// `contentViewControllers(for:)`.
///
/// ```
/// override func contentViewControllers(for state: MyViewControllerState) -> [UIViewController] {
///     switch state {
///     case .loading:
///         return [ActivityIndicatorViewController()]
///     case .empty:
///         return [myContentViewController]
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Callback methods are overridable, notifying you when a state transition is being performed, and what child
/// view controllers are being presented as a result of a state transition.
///
/// Using `willTransition(to:animated:)` you should prepare view controller representing the state being transition to
/// with the appropriate data.
///
/// ```
/// override func willTransition(to state: MyViewControllerState, animated: Bool) {
///     switch state {
///     case .ready:
///         myContentViewController.content = myLoadedContent
///     case .loading:
///         break
///     }
/// }
/// ```
/// Overriding `didTransition(to:animated:)` is an appropriate place to invoke methods that eventually results in
/// a state transition being requested using `setNeedsTransition(to:animated:)`, as it ensures that any previous state
/// transitions has been fully completed.
///
/// ```
/// override func didTransition(from previousState: MyViewControllerState?, animated: Bool) {
///     switch state {
///     case .ready:
///         break
///     case .loading:
///         model.loadData { result in
///             self.myLoadedContent = result
///             self.setNeedsTransition(to: .ready, animated: true)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// You may also override `loadContentViewControllerContainerView()` to provide a custom container view for your
/// content view controllers, allowing you to manipulate the view hierarchy above and below the content view
/// controller container view.
///
/// ## Animating state transitions
/// By default, no animations are performed between states. To enable animations, you have three options:
///
/// - Set `defaultStateTransitioningCoordinator`
/// - Override `stateTransitionCoordinator(for:)` in your `StateViewController` subclasses
/// - Conform view controllers contained in `StateViewController` to `StateViewControllerTransitioning`.
